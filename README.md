# Introduction:
* This is MingshuaiSong's ECE387 Final Individual Project. So, this is a program for a robotic car to avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensors. The car will go straight until an obstacle is detected. When encountering an obstacle, the car will stop and judge whether there are obstacles at 60 degrees and 120 degrees on the left and right and the distance of the obstacles, so as to judge the traveling direction of the car.
# Components Required:
* Arduino R3 Board
* Dual H-Bridge motor drivers L298
* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
* Servo motor 
* Jumper wires
* 6 1.5V battery
